* INSTALL

(Linux)

There are two choices to compile the AAL from source: one is building 
as kernel modules, and another is integrating the AAL into the kernel source. 
The former is required when you use MEE because MEE requires kernel integration.
Usually, the latter is sufficient.

1) Build as modules

(e.g.)
$ cd host
$ make -f Makefile.linux
make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=/work/aal/host
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.38-11-generic'
  LD      /work/aal/host/driver/knf/built-in.o
  CC [M]  /work/aal/host/driver/knf/aal_knf_driver.o
  CC [M]  /work/aal/host/driver/knf/knf_device.o
...
  LD [M]  /work/aal/host/driver/knf/aal_knf.ko
  CC      /work/aal/host/linux/aal.mod.o
  LD [M]  /work/aal/host/linux/aal.ko
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.38-11-generic'

Then, aal.ko (the base module) and aal_*.ko (device drivers for each device)
are made.


(Manycore Kernel)

AAL for manycore side should be made along with the manycore kernel.
Therefore, the build script for the manycore kernel is responsible for calling
Makefile in AAL.
