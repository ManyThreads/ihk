* INSTALL

(Linux)

There are two choices to compile the IHK from source: one is integrating 
the IHK into the kernel source, and the other is building 
as kernel modules.
The former is required when you use BUILTIN because BUILTIN requires kernel integration.
Otherwise, the latter is sufficient.

1) Build as modules

(e.g.)
$ cd host
$ make -f Makefile.linux
make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=/work/ihk/host
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.38-11-generic'
  LD      /work/ihk/host/driver/mic/built-in.o
  CC [M]  /work/ihk/host/driver/mic/ihk_mic_driver.o
  CC [M]  /work/ihk/host/driver/mic/mic_device.o
...
  LD [M]  /work/ihk/host/driver/mic/ihk_mic.ko
  CC      /work/ihk/host/linux/ihk.mod.o
  LD [M]  /work/ihk/host/linux/ihk.ko
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.38-11-generic'

Then, ihk.ko (the base module) and ihk_*.ko (device drivers for each device)
are made.


(Manycore Kernel)

IHK for manycore side should be made along with the manycore kernel.
Therefore, the build script for the manycore kernel is responsible for calling
Makefile in IHK.
